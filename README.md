# MODULE 1 PROJECT: ROLL THE DICE GAME BY LANA

direct link to my game: https://iluvswe.github.io 
(Please use Google Chrome to get the most optimal view of the game)

RULES OF THE GAME:
1. Player (You) gets to go first, before Dealer. Click "Roll The Dice" to begin the game.
2. Anyone (whether it's You or Dealer) who rolls a 1 on the dice will lose all unsaved points, and the turn goes to the other person.
3. You can only continue rolling and not lose unsaved points if you get a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on the dice each time you roll.
4. To save points to your official score (red color), simply click "Add Points To Current Score". If not, you may lose all unsaved points if you roll a 1 on the dice. Keep in mind that, however, each time you click that button, the turn then goes to the dealer and vice versa.
5. In order to win, Player or Dealer has to get a total of 20 points saved before the other person.
6. Game will automatically reset after there is a winner, or to begin a new game, click the button "Click Here To Start Over".
